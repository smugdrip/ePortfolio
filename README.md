# ePortfolio

[12/15/23] Begin development of a ePortfolio I'm going to use to display my resume and practice my react/javascript skills.

The webpage will be hosted on github pages most likely.

Here are the libraries I will be using to complete the project:

emailjs/browser
fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
fortawesome/react-fontawesome
animate.css
gsap-trial
loaders.css
react-leaflet
react-loaders
react-router-dom
sass

I will also be using some premade assets from this portfolio here:

I hope to include thre games i've made:
https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/djhorine/Under-the-Snow-Webexport/

a minesweeper game clone built in java,

a puzzlescript game.
